# Objectives
- Use Jupyter Notebooks
- Use the Pandas library to load data
- Identify and handle missing data

## Jupyter Notebooks and Datasets

In order,tea the notebooks used are: 

- 01_IntroPandas.ipynb
- 02_Pandas.ipynb
- 03_Load_Data.ipynb
- 04_BasicOperations.ipynb
- 05_Slicing.ipynb
- 06_Filtering.ipynb
- 07_RenamingDeletingColumns.ipynb
- 08_AggregateFunctions.ipynb
- 09_IdentifyingMissingData.ipynb
- 10_RemoveFillMissingData.ipynb
- 11_ConvertNumPyArrayDict.ipynb
- 12_ExportCSVExcel.ipynb

In case you are curious about how the dataset used for this first video was created, here is a link to learn more: [The Cost of Financing a Car (Car Loans)](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-cost-of-financing-a-new-car-car-loans-c00997f1aee). This concept is applicable for mortgages as well (MortgagePayment.ipynb).

## Learn by doing portion of the lecture
### We can work on and go over some basic Python exercises.  While doing these exercises, It is important to keep in mind that there are several ways to solve each of these exercises.

- Compare car interest payments on 3,5,7, and 10% fixed rate loans. 
- Assuming you get an 6% fixed 30 year home loan, what is your payment. 
- Assuming you get an 6% fixed 30 year home loan, how much interest do you pay over the course of a loan (you will have to do some research to figure this one out).
- (bonus hard question if you get bored) Assuming you got an 6% fixed 30 year home loan, and you refinance the loan 5 years into the loan at 5% fixed, what would be the difference in total interest payed between the loans.
